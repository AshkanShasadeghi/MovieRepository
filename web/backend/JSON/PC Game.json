It is very unlikely that you will finish the game once and be able to figure out all the combos.",

Mark of the Ninja is another creative game from the creators of the Shank game series, but it has a different atmosphere. The story of the game is about a ninja whose village is attacked and his master and chief of Hisomo tribe is taken hostage by a person named Kelly Corporal, who is sent by the Hessain Service group. The main character of the game has a tattoo on his body, which gives him a lot of power, but it has a negative effect on his psyche.",
      "Doing very fast moves and destroying enemies in the blink of an eye will be one of the interesting parts of Mark of the Ninja. But if you make a mistake in your moves, the enemy will destroy you with two to three blows. The game's graphics, while two-dimensional and dark, are very attractive and impressive. The effects of throwing a blindfold or going into a ghost state are beautiful. Now you can download the game Mark of the Ninja Special Edition directly and for free from Yas."

      "The year is 873 BC. Norway, one of the Vikings' headquarters, is preparing to open up and change the pages of history. The world is looking for new steps that will change the face of Europe forever. Assassin’s Creed Valhalla is an amazing journey into the heart of Viking rule, with a brave hero named Eivor and his brother Sigurd pursuing their tribal leadership in all-out attacks on Anglo-Saxon land and present-day England. Ubisoft has already released several versions of the Assassin's Creed franchise, and after traveling to London, France, ancient Egypt, and Greece, it's time to move on to the Viking era, with a new character with no traces of Assassin. Experience the UK.",
      "The character of Eivor is a full-fledged and traditional Viking who, entering the land of England, experiences a complex battle with rival kingdoms such as East Angila and Marcia, all of which seek to destroy the Vikings and expel them from the area under their control. You will see big cities like London, Winchester and York, and of course a series of game stages are followed in Norway and the northern regions, the atmosphere of which is very different from England. Assassin’s Creed Valhalla, like previous versions, uses a parallel narrative line to the modern world, in which case you follow the story of a character named Leila Hassan, who previously appeared in Origins and Odyssey. The gameplay is the most important part of the game, which includes various story and sub-stages that provide you with more than 50 hours of content.",
      "The game combat system is out of the traditional mode and any type of weapon in the environment can be used. The Vikings are known for using axes, and you can use a variety of weapons in Assassin’s Creed Valhalla. The main city of the game is one of the most attractive parts that you should pay special attention to. Initially, there will be only a few buildings and houses in the area, but you will be able to expand them, for example creating a blacksmith or expanding the headquarters to a castle. There are a variety of buildings such as museums, shipyards, fishing huts, etc., each of which can enhance the story of the game. By attending these places, you will meet new people who may have sub-stages for you, which is why it will be very difficult to complete this game completely."

    "Property": [
      "Assassin's Creed Vallaha game is visually very beautifully designed and all areas are shown in high detail. England's lush green forests are accompanied by seasonal rains that nail you together. There are many activities throughout the game, all of which are best designed, and it is not unreasonable to say that you are dealing with one of the best versions of Assassin's Creed."
